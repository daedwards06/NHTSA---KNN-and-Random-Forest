# NHTSA KNN and Random Forest

Perform predictive analysis (classification) upon a data set: model the dataset using KNN and Random Forest, and making conclusions from the analysis.

# Data Preparation

- Define and prepare your class variables
- Describe the final dataset that is used for classification

# Modeling and Evaluation

- Choose and explain the evaluation metrics that will be used (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure)
- Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing splits
- Create three different classification/regression models
- Analyze the results using the chosen method of evaluation. Use visualizations of the results to bolster the analysis
- Discuss the advantages of each model for each classification

# Deployment

- Discuss how useful the model could be for interested parties

# Exceptional Work

- Provide additional analyses
